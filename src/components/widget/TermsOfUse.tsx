You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, to any Services sold or distributed through the Site, including Omnihorse NFTs, or to any aspect of your relationship with Omnihorse will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Omnihorse may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br></p><p style=\"padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;\">Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at</p><p style=\"padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"mailto:info@omnihorse.io\" class=\"a\" target=\"_blank\">info@omnihorse.io.</a> The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br></p><p style=\"padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: left;\">Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Omnihorse. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual</p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;\">under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. And you agree that to the extent monetary or non-monetary remedy or relief is granted, such request for relief may be enforced as needed by any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br></p><p style=\"padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: left;\">Waiver of Jury Trial.

You and Omnihorse are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as otherwise indicated in this Section 14. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p style=\"padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: left;\">Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.

If a decision</p><p style=\"padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;\">is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of New York.
